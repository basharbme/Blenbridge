Blenbridge should run without issue on recent
Ubuntu and derivatives. If it does not run on
a particular Linux distro, the author apologizes.
Blenbridge 1.18 was built using Lazarus 1.8.4.
Compiling using Lazarus should be straightforward.
In case of difficulty installing Lazarus 1.8.4,
refer this this post: https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php/topic,41524.0.html

The .pas and .lfm files are slightly different for the
two platforms and for best results should not be 
swapped.
